#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

# welcome to the final project of today. And in this final project, we're going to be building a Tip Calculator.
# It's going to print "Welcome to the tip calculator!"
# and it's going to ask you for an input for how much the total bill came to.
# Let's say that we and a couple of friends went out for lunch and it came to $124.56.
# And then it'll ask you, what percentage tip would you like to give? 
# So let's say we want to give a 12% tip. So we enter 12 and hit Enter.
# And then finally it asks, how many people are splitting this bill?
# Let's say there's seven of us.And then hit Enter.
# Finally, it's going to tell us that each person should pay about $19.93.
# Notice how the final bill, even though after all of these calculations,
# it's probably got more numbers after the decimal point, we only want two decimal places of accuracy,
# so it should be rounded to two decimal places.
# The second thing to remember is that these are percentages, and in order to calculate a percentage of something,
# you can multiply a number by the percentage number divided by 100.
# Let me show you this in a little bit more detail,
